# HauntedChurch
Horror Jam - "Haunting Melody"


# Repo Download instructions
I recommend installing the Github client - https://desktop.github.com/

In the application:

File > Clone repository > HauntedChurch
- should show up if you're added as a collaborator

Make a folder to keep it in and hit Clone

# Unity Setup Instructions:
Download Unity - https://unity.com/download

Install

# In Unity Hub:
Click the arrow by "Open" and navigate to the top folder of the repository "HauntedChurch"

This should open the project in the Unity editor and it will look complicated but you only need to worry about like 3 things

# In the editor:
On the bottom you should see the Project files and stuff

Assets > Scenes > Map and double click to load that scene

The only things in this scene is two tilemaps: one for the ground and one for any walls/obstacles

From the top menu:
Window > 2D > Tile Palette

This should have 2 palettes, one for floor tiles and one for wall tiles where i just kinda threw everything that looked like a wall maybe

Now just choose the paintbrush tool from the palette and the tile you want to paint and draw on the grid

(Make sure you choose the right tilemap from the hierarchy on the left)

Go crazy

I haven't figured out if you can rotate tiles yet so don't worry about it looking entirely correct. Just put down the general layout of the church

If there's any tiles I didn't include that you want on the palette do this:
- Go to the Sprites folder in the Project menu on the bottom
- click the arrow next to the Spritesheet
- drag any sprites you want to add from the folder to the palette

# Committing changes
Once you've made some changes you're happy with save everything

Go back to the Github client

You should see everything you changed listed on the left under Changes

Just make sure all the checkboxes are selected, type a message, and hit "Commit to master"

Now it should have a blue button on the right that says "Push Origin" hit that

that should be about it
